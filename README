                   ===============================

VolWheel is a little icon that lives in your notification area which allows you
to quickly change the sound volume. You can do a right-click, left-click,
middle-click, scroll up and down... I let you discover.

For help on how to use VolWheel, type 'volwheel --help'.

VolWheel is shipped with a few icons and icon themes. You can very easily make
new icons and themes for VolWheel. Take a look in /usr/share/volwheel/icons/ to
see how it works.
